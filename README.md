## About

Automatically embed YouTube or Kick onto [destiny.gg/bigscreen](https://www.destiny.gg/bigscreen).

## Installation

Install Tampermonkey
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

Open the script https://github.com/zX3no/dgg-live-embed-script/raw/main/dgg-live-embed.user.js and click install.

Refresh.

## Issues

If the YouTube stream goes down it won't automatically switch to Kick.

If Destiny goes offline it will still display the embeded stream. A refresh will fix this.
